This file contains a TODO list for project evolution.

* Improve unit test coverage of communications subsystem
* Implement Communicator that is able to send and receive messages async and sync. Application should use this class explicitly for sending a message.
* Application should receive messages asynchronously, validate them for correctness and apply to the model.
* Communicator should detect broken connection and report it as unrecoverable error.
* Create Communicator in such a way that it is easily extendible to:
  - Have retry logic of reestablishing the connection
  - Have multiple connections and possibility to broadcast, multicast or singlecast to any of them.
